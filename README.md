# PARKING LOT TRACKER

**Problem statement:-**

There is a parking lot and it has 2 levels A and B, each level has the capacity to park 20
vehicles of any size. Level A has parking space numbered from 1-20 and level B has parking
space numbered from 21-40.

Use this information to build a system that supports below
mentioned operations.
1. Automatically assign a parking space to a new vehicle.
2. Retrieve parking spot number of any particular vehicle(consider vehicle number as the
unique identifier of the vehicle.) output should return level and parking spot number eg
{“level”: A, “spot”:19}

● So, we will design and build a terminal based application which facilitates above two operations using python language.
