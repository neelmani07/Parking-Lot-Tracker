This file is intended to cover some of the thoughts/questions that arose while
designing the architecture.

* I have tried to focus on the scalability of the design keeping in mind that the floor number and slots
for each floor can be scaled up. Therefore, Â have made use of a separate class called Slot
rather than just hardcoding the floor and its spot numbers.

* I have also designed the parking lot to provide an option for Un-Parking.
If just Parking and retrieval were to be designed, the structure could have been direct and short,
But to design the structure in order to be scalable and more attractive, I thought of implementing Unparking too.

* I am aware of the fact that are many ways to solve a problem. Here, I have tried to implement it one way. I am very much eager and willing to learn better ways to solve this problem. I am always available for discussion and learning.
