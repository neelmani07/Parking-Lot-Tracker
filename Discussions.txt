This file is intentded to cover some of the thoughts/questions that arose while
designing the architecture.

* I have tried to focus on the scalability of the design keeping in mind that the floor number and slots
for each floor can be scaled up. Therefore ,  have made use of a separate class called Slot
rather than just hardcoding the floor and its spot numbers.

* I have also designed the parking lot to provide an option for Un Parking.
If just Parking and retrieval was to be designed, the structure could have been direct and short,
But to design the structure in order to be sclable and more attractive, I thought of implementing Unparking too.
